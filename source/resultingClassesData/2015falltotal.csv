This writing seminar will examine various approaches to the subject, with a particular focus on how a compelling story might be told, especially when conveying scientific data and abstract ideas. What makes a story compelling? Memorable? Inspiring? Well frame our discussion and writings around a variety of nonfiction (literary and investigative journalism, media, film, and graphic novels).
