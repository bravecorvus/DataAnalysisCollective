In addition to examining reviews in newspapers, magazines, and other mass-media, we will read the work of well-known cultural critics such as James Agee, Manny Farber, Pauline Kael, Andrew Sarris, the members of Cahiers du Cinéma, Jonathan Rosenbaum, and Girish Shambu as well as more polemical and academic writings that focus on the impact of film on class, gender, race and other social formations.
