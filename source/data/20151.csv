Can the Bible be used to guide our economic as well as spiritual practices? Understanding that economics means the law of the household, this section will read the Bible in light of questions about issues such as wealth, prosperity, taxes, private property, and the market. To do so, we will look at the economic structures and concerns of a diverse biblical world rooted in an agrarian economy, tracing the recurrence of themes such as poverty, oppression, idolatry and the care for the land. Alongside of this focus on the Bible itself, we will examine how philosophers, theologians, and economists read the Bible to support certain economic practices, both in the past and within the contemporary context.

Because food is prominent in biblical narratives it is a useful interpretative lens. Biblical prophets make food central in their vindication of the poor and hungry. Biblical communities announce, debate, adjust, and renounce dietary prescriptions. Biblical texts employ similes, metaphors, and parables derived from food to advance larger points about spiritual growth or fulfillment. Guided by these considerations, we will address four main themes involving food and biblical traditions: (1) distributive food justice; (2) food production and care of the land; (3) food and just treatment of animals; and (4) food choices as religiously meaningful.","['BTS-B']","","","","['David Booth']","100","['OM 020']","Bible/Culture/Commun","Section Topic: Land, Food and Justice in Biblical Traditions","121","False","False","R","1","C","20151","['MWF 0200-0255PM']","Bible in Culture and Community","Research","2015"

Science writers face the difficult task of translating and communicating technical and complex findings into summaries that lay audiences can easily understand. This can be further complicated as audiences vary widely in their needs, expertise, and expectations, and thus science writers need to adjust their writing styles accordingly. In this seminar, we will read primary science resources, blogs, opinion pieces, magazines, books, and additional texts to explore how science writing can contribute to the public understanding of science.

This seminar is ideal for students interested in the phenomenon of human language, its changes over time and space, its beauty and persuasive power, and its roles in social and cultural identities. Questions we will address include: How does gender impact our language? How has the English language changed in the last 450 years? Why are bad words bad? How do advertisers manipulate language? What does txtng do 2 yr language? Varied reading assignments, including journalism, memoir, and drama, show us how some authors have thought through these questions. We discuss these authors ideas and the moves they make as writers. Writing assignments draw on our readings, on personal experience and the results of your inquisitive research. We give sustained attention to writing as an ongoing process, devoting substantial time to workshops of multiple drafts.","['FYW']","","","","['Karen E.

The globe continues to warm, ice continues to melt at an alarming pace, and the seas continue to rise. Climate change is already happening. Yet, according to a 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center, only 40% of Americans cited climate change as a major threat. So what gives? Why arent people getting the message? Are we delivering it wrong? Do we need more stories, and better storytellers? This writing seminar will examine various approaches to the subject, with a particular focus on how a compelling story might be told, especially when conveying scientific data and abstract ideas. What makes a story compelling? Memorable? Inspiring? Well frame our discussion and writings around a variety of nonfiction (literary and investigative journalism, media, film, and graphic novels). In class, students write responses to assigned reading or films, work in small writing groups to give and receive feedback, and work on exercises that take up a certain element covered in our writing handbook.

Digital technologies offer innovative possibilities for refashioning ourselves, creating communities, and producing academic knowledge in the twenty-first century; on the other hand, digital technologies might also prove harmful to meaningful pen-and-paper work that has been done in the liberal arts for centuries.
